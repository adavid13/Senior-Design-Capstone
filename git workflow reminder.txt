High level git concept (not adding and committing):


step 0 (make sure you're up to date):
git fetch origin

step 1 (create a new branch for your own work):
git checkout -b temp

step 2 (save your work in cloud):
git push origin temp

step 3 (squash insignificant commits and make commit history easy to read)
git rebase -i master

p.s. after step 3, when you save your work it may be behind the remote, so to overwrite the remote use:
git push origin temp -f

step 4 (merge master to your branch in case master has changed):
git merge master

step 5 (update master branch):
Go to your branch on gitlab, and click "Create merge request"
Ask someone to approve your merge request
