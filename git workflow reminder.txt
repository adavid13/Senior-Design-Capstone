High level git concept (not adding and committing):


step 0 (make sure you're up to date):
git fetch origin
git pull

step 1 (create a new branch for your own work):
git checkout -b temp

step 2 (save your work in cloud):
git push origin temp

step 3 (squash insignificant commits and make commit history easy to read)
git rebase -i master
#TODO: describe how to squash merge commits (add --preserve-merges flag?)

p.s. after step 3, when you save your work it may be behind the remote, so to overwrite the remote use:
git push origin temp -f

step 4 (merge master to your branch in case master has changed):
git checkout master
git fetch origin
git pull
git checkout temp
git merge master
git rebase -i master (automatically squashes merge commits, so they don't appear in the interactive menu)

step 5 (update master branch):
Save work, then go to your branch on gitlab, and click "Create merge request"
Ask someone to approve your merge request
