          <h4>Object</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>The Object of the game is to surround your opponent's King.
            <br>
            The pieces surrounding the King can a combination of both your pieces and the opponent's pieces.
            <br>
            The first player to surround their opponent's King wins.
        </p>

        <div class="col">
          <h4>Gameplay</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p>The game begins with one player placing a piece from their hand in the center of the table
              and the opponent placing one of their pieces next to it.
              <br>
              Players then take turns to either place or move any one of their pieces.              
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h4>Placing</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p>A new piece can be introduced into the game at any time. However, with the exception of the first piece placed by each player,
              new pieces may not be placed next to a piece of the opponent's color.
              <br>
              It is possible to win the game without placing all your pieces.
              <br>
              Following every move, the player needs to click "End Turn" to confirm their move.
              <br>
              Once a move has been confirmed, the piece cannot be removed.
              <br>
              A player can choose to undo their move before confirming by clicking "Undo".
              <br>
              The King must be placed by move four.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h4>Moving</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p>Once the King has been placed (but not before), you can decide whether to use each turn after that
            to place another tile or to move one of the pieces that have already been placed.
            <br>
            Each creature has its own way of moving about the board 
            and it is possible to move pieces to a position where they touch one or more of your opponent's tiles.
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> All pieces must always touch at least one other piece. 
            If a piece is the only connection between two parts of the cluster, it may not be moved.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h4>The creatures</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p>
            <strong>King</strong>
            <br>
            The King can move only one space per turn. Even though it is restricted in this way, 
            if moved at the right time it can severely disrupt your opponent's plans.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Mage</strong>
            <br>
            The Mage, like the King, moves only one space per turn. Unlike any other creature though,
            it can also move on top of the creates.
            <br>
            A piece with a Mage on top of it is unable to move and for the purposes of the placing rules, the stack takes on the color of the Mage.
            <br>
            From its position on top of the creatures, the Mage can move from tile to tile across the top of the board. 
            It can also drop into spaces that are surrounded and therefore not accessible to most other creatures.
            <br>
            The only way to block a Mage that is on top of the creatures is to move another Mage on top of it. 
            All four Mages can be stacked on top of each other.
            <br>
            <b>Note: </b>When it is first placed, the Mage is placed in the same way as all other pieces. 
            It cannot be placed directly on top of a creature, even though it can be moved there later.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Stealth</strong>
            <br>
            The Stealth does not move around the outside of the creature cluster like the other creatures. 
            Instead, it jumps from its space over any number of pieces (but at least one) to the next unoccupied space along a straight row of joined pieces.
            <br>
            This gives it the advantage of being able to fill in a space which is surrounded by other tiles.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Barbarian</strong>
            <br>
            The Barbarian moves three spaces per turn - no more, no less.
            <br>
            It must move in a direct path and cannot backtrack on itself. 
            It may only move around pieces that it is in direct contact with on each step of its move,
            and it may not move across to a piece that it is not in direct contact with.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Knight</strong>
            <br>
            The Knight can move from its position to any other position around the board provided the restrictions are adhered to. 
            This freedom of movement makes the Knight one of the most valuable pieces.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h4>Restrictions</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p>
            <strong>One cluster rule</strong>
            <br>
            The pieces in play must be linked at all times. At no time can you leave a piece stranded (not joined to the cluster) or separate the cluster in two.
            <br>
            Use this rule to your advantage by moving your pieces to strategic positions around the cluster, leaving your opponent's key pieces unable to move.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Freedom to move</strong>
            <br>
            The creatures can only move in a sliding movement. 
            If a piece is surrounded to the point that it can no longer physically slide out of its position, it may not be moved.
            <br>
            The only exceptions are the Stealth, which can jump into or out of a space, and the Mage, which can also climb up or down.
            <br>
            Similarly, no piece may move into a space that it cannot physically slide into.
            <br>
            <b>Note: </b>When first introduced to the game, a piece may be placed into a space that is surrounded as long as it does not violate any of the placing rules,
            in particular, the rule about pieces not being allowed to touch pieces of the other color when they are first placed.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Unable to move or place</strong>
            <br>
            If a player can neither place a new piece nor move an existing piece, the turn passes to their opponent who then takes their turn again.
            <br>
            The game continues in this way until the player is able to move or place one of their pieces, 
            or until the game is lost with the surrounding of their King.
            <br>
            <br>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h4>End of the Game</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p>The game ends as soon as one King is completely surrounded by pieces of any color.
            <br>
            The person whose King is surrounded loses the game unless the last piece to surround 
            their King also completes the surround of the other King. In that case, the game is drawn.
            <br>
            A draw may also be agreed if both players are in a position where they are forced to move the same two pieces over and over again,
            without any possibility of the stalemate being resolved.
            <br>
